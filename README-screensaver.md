# Screensaver application

## What it does

The [Molecule of the Month] screensaver is an experiment in developing an
add-on to the [Muzei App].

The intent of this sub-project is to provide a visual menu of
the awesome work by [David S Goodsell] in creating over 20 years
of images for the Molecule of the Month.

For more on the [muzei-story] just google about a bit.   And there are
a number of interesting apps that work with Muzei to provide
menus of great art and images.

This application is a derivate of the [example-unsplash] app contained in the
muzei github repo.
